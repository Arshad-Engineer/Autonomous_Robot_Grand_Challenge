# Autonomous_Robot_Grand_Challenge
This semester we will have 3x True Red blocks, 3x True Green blocks, and 3x True Blue blocks in the Grand Challenge.  To receive a maximum score of 9/9, your robot must successfully transport the red, green, and blue blocks to the Construction Zone in proper order.  Any adversarial blocks (colors other than red, green, or blue) will count as a point deduction for each that ends up in the Construction Zone.
