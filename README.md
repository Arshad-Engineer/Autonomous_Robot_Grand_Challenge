# Autonomous_Robot_Grand_Challenge
This grand challenge will have 3x True Red blocks, 3x True Green blocks, and 3x True Blue blocks in the Grand Challenge.  To receive a maximum score of 9/9, robot must successfully transport the red, green, and blue blocks to the Construction Zone in proper order.  Any adversarial blocks (colors other than red, green, or blue) will count as a point deduction for each that ends up in the Construction Zone. Each block will be spaced by atleast 1 ft distance.

## The project involves the key concepts:
+ Object Tracking
+ Object Retrieval
+ Monocular Camera Depth estimation
+ PID Control
+ Collision Avoidance
+ Localization (Odometry)

## Main Sensors: 
Raspberry Pi Camera, Sonar, IMU, Motor Encoders
## Effectors:
